               Transaction Checkout Data Analysis
          The Transaction checkout data is a CSV file of 3255 rows with four columns the "I.d", "Country_code," "Currency"  and "Status" making up the transaction records. . "Status" indicates whether the transaction was successful or not. "Currency" provides the currency Subscribers tried to pay with. "Country_code" indicates the country the customer's card is from.
 I extracted,cleaned,wrangled and transformed the data to get it  ready for analysis. I used Excel and Microsoft PowerBi  to perform the  ETL(Extract, transform and Load),Data query, EDA(Exploratory data analysis) and Visualization.
